🌦️ Weather App
Created by: Reuben Aby

The Weather App is a simple web application that displays the current weather in Celsius for a specified city. Users input a city name, and the app fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API. If a city is invalid or misspelled, the app shows an error message. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app is lightweight and responsive.

🔑 Key Features
Weather Display: Shows temperature in Celsius, weather description, humidity, etc.

Error Handling: Alerts users if the city name is misspelled or not found.

Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML: Defines structure (input field, button, and display area).

CSS: Styles the interface for readability and responsiveness.

JavaScript: Handles API requests, displays weather data, and manages errors.
